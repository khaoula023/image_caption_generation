# üñºÔ∏è Image Caption Generation for Arabic using Generative Models

This project focuses on **generating Arabic image captions** using **multiple large-scale generative models** such as **Google Gemini** and **Gemma**, applied to the **Flickr dataset**.  
It explores the ability of modern vision-language models to produce high-quality, semantically rich, and linguistically coherent Arabic captions.

## üöÄ Project Overview

Recent advances in multimodal AI have made it possible to generate descriptive captions directly from images.  
However, most research focuses on English, leaving Arabic image captioning underexplored.  
This project aims to fill that gap by comparing and evaluating generative models that can handle Arabic outputs.

**Key Features:**
- Uses **Google Gemini** and **Gemma** generative models.
- Generates **Arabic captions** for images from the **Flickr dataset** (Flickr8k or Flickr30k).
- Includes **evaluation metrics** for assessing caption quality.
- Supports **daily batch processing** and **dataset sampling** to manage resource limitations.
